## :dart: Objectives

[Azoth] Operating System aims to resolve the historical trade-off between
**speed** and **security**.

1. **Context Latency Elimination:** - Use Software Isolation (SFI) via
   WebAssembly to avoid expensive hardware "Context Switches".
   - Achieve an inter-process communication (IPC) speed
     close to the native function call speed.
